# Example Artifacts

Reference copies of build artifacts and tooling output from the HelloArty
FPGA pipeline. These files are checked in so that readers can inspect the
full compilation and synthesis flow without running Vivado or having a board
connected.

## Compiler Output

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `helloarty.sv` | SystemVerilog generated by Composer (Clef &rarr; MLIR &rarr; CIRCT &rarr; SV). This is the current output from `Composer compile`. |

## Vivado Synthesis

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `synth.tcl` | TCL script driving Vivado batch-mode synthesis (`synth_design` &rarr; `place_design` &rarr; `route_design` &rarr; `write_bitstream`). |
| `program.tcl` | TCL script for JTAG programming via Vivado Hardware Manager. |
| `vivado.log` | Full Vivado synthesis log including post-route timing. Contains the WNS (Worst Negative Slack) that calibrates the compiler's Layer 1 depth analysis. |

## Build and Deploy Scripts

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `build.sh` | Four-stage pipeline: compile &rarr; synthesize &rarr; JTAG program &rarr; SPI flash. See `--help` for stage selection flags. |
| `flash.sh` | Standalone flash programming script (openFPGALoader). |
| `flash.tcl` | TCL-based flash programming via Vivado Hardware Manager. |

## Diagnostic Screenshot

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `screenshot-2026-02-22_22-59-52.png` | Terminal output showing `--warnaserror` elevating CCS0100 combinational depth warnings to errors. Demonstrates the compiler's two-layer timing architecture: Layer 1 (structural heuristic) catches deep chains early, before Vivado synthesis confirms with ground truth. |
